# GreenThreads Denver Store #13 — HR Staffing Analyst Assistant

staffing, pay-gap, and applicant-funnel questions directly from the store's own case data —
without inventing numbers the data doesn't support.

**Project name in ChatGPT:** `[Your exact project name]`

## What This Assistant Does

This assistant is the AI analyst scoped in HW#1's Quarterly Staffing Forecasting opportunity,
built out as a working ChatGPT project. It answers questions about Denver Store #13's applicant
pipeline, pay gaps vs. market rate, decline reasons, and the staffing recommendation from HW#3 —
grounded strictly in the uploaded case files, with explicit rules against fabricating numbers.
Answers separate **Confirmed**, **Calculated**, and **Unconfirmed** evidence and end with a short
"So what for HR" takeaway.
